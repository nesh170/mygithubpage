    "description": "Lost and Found is a web application developed by Ankit Kayastha, James Mosca, Shelley Wu and me (Siva Loganathan). It was developed to tackle the Duke Communityâ€™s lack of a standard, consistent Lost and Found platform for students, faculty, and staff. Currently, there is no clear channel that links people who have lost items to those who have found the respective lost items, and the goal of this application is to bridge that communication gap. The application is meant to enable members of the Duke Community to more easily retrieve and report on lost and found items. \n This project uses a PostgreSQL database which was communicated to the backend layer using JOOQ. We also used Duke University's OAuth system and Streamer OIT API to allow secure login and also to obtain information about the user. In addition to that, we used Amazon Web Services to send emails (Simple Mail Service) and their S3 file system. The front end was mostly written in AngularJS 1.0.",
